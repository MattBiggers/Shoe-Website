# Shoe-Website
Our plan is to be able to make a website that is able to act as a middle man that is able to allow online users to buy and sell items (In this case shoes) with other users. This is a Ebay like store. A user is able to make an account which makes it easier to buy and sell within the site. As of right now, this site (thesolestop.com) is a virtual marketplace.
